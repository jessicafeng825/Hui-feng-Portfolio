I set up and rectified assets, optimized assets, packaged maps, and made shaders. At the same time, I needed to use lighting knowledge to create a standard lighting scene including scenes and characters, including lighting in various time periods in the morning, midnight and evening.


During my period, I learned the basic operations and functions of UE4, including materials, art asset settings, lighting and post-processing effects, etc.
