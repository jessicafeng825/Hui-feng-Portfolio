the peak value of single frame fillrate multiple = the peak value of single frame fillrate/ frame rendering camera resolution

single frame fillrate multiple = single frame fillrate/ frame rendering camera resolution

GPU actual fillrate multiple = The total number of fills in this frame /screen resolution to which this frame is projected ;The higher the value, the greater the overdraw rate.

GPU fillrate multiple peak =  the peak of GPU actual fillrate multiple

actual fillrate multiple = Add the actual GPU fillrates multiples of all cameras .and also shows the maximum of actual fillrates.
