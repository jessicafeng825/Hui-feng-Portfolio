The Snow is using PBR shaing and PBR textures,including Albedo, Normal, Metallic, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion, Emission Maps. What's more , Metallic, Roughness, Ambient Occlusion, Emission Maps are compressed into one picture, respectively in the RGBA channel.

When rendering snow, it is divided into upper snow and lower snow materials to be rendered separately, and then blend them.
